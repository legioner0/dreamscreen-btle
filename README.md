Python interface to DreamScreen via Bluetooth LE

This is a project to provide an API to control DreamScreen (http://www.dreamscreentv.com/)
via Bluetooth Low Energy from Python. At present it runs on Linux only; 
I've mostly developed it using a Raspberry Pi, but it will also run on x86 Debian Linux.

The code is tested on Python 2.7 and 3.4; it should also work on 3.3.

The code is based on official DreamScreen BLE commands documentation (http://dreamscreen.boards.net/thread/22/dreamscreen-ble-command-set) and answers of 
DreamScreen developers (thanks, Kyle).
